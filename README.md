#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

A) Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software Engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
 Importance;

 1. Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare 
    ,finance.
 
 2. Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.

 3. Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.

 4. Security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.


 B) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.   

Mastering complexity - This is the ability of managing and minimizing the interactions within a software system by having design principles, coding practices and development modules.  

Mastering process - This is the ability to develop strong problem solving skills.                                                                                                                      

Mastering machine - This is gaining a deeper understanding of the machine learning algorithms.

C) List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  
   Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
  
   Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
   
   Design - building the framework. 
   
   Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
   
   Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches.

E) Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
      
  - There is Low flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
     
  - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
     
  - Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
     
   - High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
  
   - Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 

   - Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer
 
 - They develop applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.

 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 

 - collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.

 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer 
 
 - They collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.

 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow

 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 

 - analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 

 - develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.

Project Manager 
 
 -They assembles and lead the software development team.
               
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.

 - create blueprint for the project.

 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.

 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

F) Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform where software applications are created by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code eg Visual Studio Code.
 
 Importance:
a) Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured and IDE knows the rules, hence containing many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.

b) An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors, hence interesting to read.

c) An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.

d) IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. 

e) An IDE converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. 

f) The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.

g) Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, as it runs and inspect code behavior. 

h) IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems(VCS) -They are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.eg Git

Importance:
 
  - Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
 
  - Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
  
  - Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
  
  - Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors.

G) What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.

  Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their 
               skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -

- Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high 
                     pressure to meet tight deadlines.

  Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable 
               sprints. 

- Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data 
                           storage architectures. 

   Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.

- Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often subjected to frequent changes, making it 
                                   challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while 
                                   accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 

    Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and 
                modular design, hence breaking it down to manageable components.

- Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 

  Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats

- Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 

  Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

H) Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

 Unit tests

 - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the 
    classes, components, or modules used by your software. 
 
 Integration tests

 - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 
 System testing 

 - Focus on the entire software system as a whole.

 - It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, 
    the usage and security .

Acceptance tests

 - Formal tests whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment like surveys.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Importance:

Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.

Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: Tell me about stuff online.
 
Improved Prompt: Provide a summary of current trends in social media usage on Instagram as of February 2025.

This version is clear, specific, and concise. It names the platform (Instagram), focuses on a topic (social media usage trends), and sets a time frame (February 2025).

Why It’s More Effective: The improved prompt gives me a precise target to aim for, ensuring the response is relevant and tailored to the user’s likely interest.
